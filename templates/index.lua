<h2>What is this?</h2>

An English (based on Team HGG's translation) info site for Monster Hunter Portable 3rd.


<h2>Can you add my translation?</h2>

Send it to me in a non-stupid format and sure.


<h2>Can I use your data in my own projects?</h2>

Sure, and to make things easier I've got it all in <a href="http://www.json.org">JSON format</a> <a href="https://github.com/mikejsavage/MHP3DB/tree/master/data">on GitHub</a>.
<br>
You can find docs for it <a href="https://github.com/mikejsavage/MHP3DB/tree/master/data/temp/docs">here</a> (sorry for some of them being poor/missing/incomplete)
<br><br>
No need to ask before using or even give credit, I'm not bothered at all.


<h2>GitHub? So I can use your code?</h2>

Sure, it's <a href="https://github.com/mikejsavage/MHP3DB/blob/master/license.txt">WTFPL licensed</a> so you can do what you like with it.
<br>
<small>(keep in mind that this is the first proper project I've done in Lua and my code is almost certainly awful)</small>
