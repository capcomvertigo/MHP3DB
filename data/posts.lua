return {{["date"]=1300996194,["content"]="<h3>SEO 101</h3>I've bought the domain <a href=\"http://p3db.com/\">p3db.com</a>\
and changed the name of the site to P3DB to match. I've been eyeing it for a while, but it seems it takes\
a domain <s>30 days</s> <s>35 days</s> goddamn forever to expire. divinewh.im is a bit awkward to type and gets\
absolutely <em>horrible</em> search ranking. Some stats:\
<ul>\
	<li>Visits to TriDB this month: <b>over 70,000</b></li>\
	<li>Referrals from Google this month: <b>1,105</b></li>\
</ul>\
Yes, that is less than 2%. No, really. And it gets better:\
<ul>\
	<li>The click through rate when searching for divinewh.im (the site's URL!) is <b>18%</b></li>\
</ul>\
Have I set a world record?\
<br><br>\
There's also been a little general progress - monster icons are all\
there now (although they definitely need a little improvement) and the\
HH tree has received some attention. Expect more to be added this\
weekend.\

- Mike",},{["date"]=1300642552,["content"]="Over the last week or so I've added 150+ weapons, which has brought the\
weapon trees to over 50% completion. It should be quite obvious which\
weapons I like in this game. There still a few sharpness bars missing/without Sharpness +1 here and there and none of the trees are actually complete\
yet - LS is the closest with six remaining.\
\
<br><br>\
\
Since I dropped some figures, I guess I should do a proper progress\
report for those who are interested:\
\
<ul>\
	<li>The weapon trees are <b>55.9%</b> done</li>\
	<li>The armor lists are <b>87.6%</b> done - I think there's just\
		Atea S and event equipment left to add</li>\
	<li>The decorations list is <b>98.2%</b> done with just three\
		remaining</li>\
	<li>The sissy weapon trees are <b>49.8%</b> complete, which is\
		surprising since I've added maybe five upgrades</li>\
</ul>\
\
<br>\
\
I added the monsters section this afternoon but it's currently in quite a\
sad state, both site wise and code wise. It should begin to look better\
as I add the remaining monster icons (most of them...) and things like\
break rewards. Hitzone info is also a high priority since the damage\
calculator depends on it, and who didn't love that?\

- Mike",},{["date"]=1299939185,["content"]="An obvious change I've made is adding this section instead of the commits\
list. It got replaced because I tend to make lots of commits over a few\
days before uploading the changes to this site (due to incompleteness etc)\
so more often than not a bunch of them would get cut off. My commit\
messages sometimes <a href=\"https://github.com/mikejsavage/MHP3DB/commit/3d20fc41a3f2196fbfa1148408c800ffa46f192c\">aren't</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/mikejsavage/MHP3DB/commit/37730fa5b30b8cbc371b128d08c03b501b590b44\">very</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/mikejsavage/MHP3DB/commit/22192dafa6a736a7bd99396e0a6b4348d6a6a681\">helpful</a> either.\
<br><br>\
Another change is the addition of protips at the top of the page. As with <a href=\"http://divinewh.im/\">TriDB</a>, there will be a mix of tongue in cheek and serious tips, and hopefully nothing that's blindingly obvious. If you have any, please send\
them in! You'll have to use the <a href=\"http://divinewh.im/f/\">TriDB\
feedback form</a> for now, as creating a separate one for here isn't\
high on my list of things to do.\
<br><br>\
If anyone knows how to extract things like quest data and monster carve\
info from the game, I'd very much appreciate it if you could tell me how\
using the form I linked to above.\
