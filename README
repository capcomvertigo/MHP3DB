There's not a lot here right now, but since most of the pages will be
identical to those on TriDB, those should be done fairly quickly. Adding
actual data will take some time.

I made a repo for it because I want to see if building a website like
this works well or not.


Typos:
Pouage Pectus S -> Rouage Pectus S
Urukuru Leggings S -> Urukusu Leggings S
Rangura Greaves/Leggings S -> Ranguro Greaves/Leggings S
