There's not a lot here right now, but since most of the pages will be
identical to those on TriDB, those should be done fairly quickly. Adding
actual data will take some time however.

None of the docs are set in stone right now as I've not played the game
enough to know if they need changing or not.

I made a repo for it because I want to see if building a website like
this works well or not.
